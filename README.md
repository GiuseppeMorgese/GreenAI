# Green AI: How constraint based tools can be used for sustainability and for achieving the SDG objectives
This research project has been carried out for the first module's exam of the "Languages and Algorithms for AI" course at University of Bologna. The evaluation of the project led to the maximum score available for the specifc module. 
The realization of this project gave me the possibility to better understand how AI techniques can be used to achieve sustainability and how we need to change our approach in order to make AI more sustainable.
